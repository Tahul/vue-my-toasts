# Introduction

Most toast plugins out here comes with a pre-defined style.

I love some of these plugins, but you can't assume that your design will be used in every projects.

This plugin aims to abstract what is boring in creating a toast notification plugin.

So you can focus on designing your toast component while keeping a simple API to interact with.

<div style="margin-top: 4rem; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
    <Illustration />
</div>
